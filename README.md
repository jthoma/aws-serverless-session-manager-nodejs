# aws-serverless-session-manager-nodejs
Session Manager for AWS Serverless application in NodeJS with no framework dependency


# Just started and is a WIP 
Hope to get this done soon and associate with an AWS SAM Template to satisfy the dependencies from AWS Managed Services.

* AWS ElastiCache MemCached

* Registration with NPM 

Will be working on this on my free time and get this done at the earliest.
